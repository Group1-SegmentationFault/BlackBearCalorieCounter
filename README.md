# BlackBearCalorieCounter

The Black Bear Calorie Counter is an android application designed to help users track their intake of calories and macronutrients in order to help them gain, maintain, or lose weight (depending on their personal goals).

The app is in very early stages of development. Android Studio is currently the primary tool for development, which uses Java and XML as languages.

Planned features:

-The app will give an estimated caloric and macronutrient intake for users based on the the user's age, weight, height, and weight goals (gain, maintain, or lose weight).

-Users will be able to track the foods they eat and recieve their estimated calorie content by searching for the food in a search query or by scanning the UPC barcode.

-Graphs and statistics will aid the user in visualizing their intake over time.

-Users have a section to record and track daily workouts.

-Users can chose to track their steps, even while the application is suspended.

Currently the software consists of a initial login screen and an activity that leads to a home screen. This app can be tested by cloning the repository into Android Studio and using a built in emulator.
